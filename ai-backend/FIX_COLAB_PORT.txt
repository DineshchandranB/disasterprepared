I'm getting "Address already in use" error when trying to restart my Flask server in Google Colab. The old Flask process is still running on port 5000.

Problem:
- Flask server is running on port 5000
- When I try to restart with updated code, I get "Address already in use"
- The old process is blocking the new one
- ngrok is tunneling to the old server, not the new one

Solution needed:
1. Kill any existing Flask processes on port 5000
2. Start Flask on a clean port
3. Update ngrok to tunnel to the correct port
4. Ensure the new code is actually running

Please provide Colab code that:

```python
# 1. Kill existing Flask processes
import os
import signal
import psutil

# Find and kill processes on port 5000
for proc in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name', 'connections']):
    try:
        for conn in proc.connections():
            if conn.laddr.port == 5000:
                print(f"Killing process {proc.pid} on port 5000")
                os.kill(proc.pid, signal.SIGKILL)
    except:
        pass

# 2. Kill ngrok processes
!pkill ngrok

# 3. Wait a moment
import time
time.sleep(2)

# 4. Start Flask on port 5000 (now free)
from threading import Thread
from pyngrok import ngrok

def run_flask():
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=False, use_reloader=False)

# Start Flask in background thread
flask_thread = Thread(target=run_flask, daemon=True)
flask_thread.start()

# Wait for Flask to start
time.sleep(3)

# 5. Start ngrok tunnel
public_url = ngrok.connect(5000)
print(f"\n✅ Flask running on port 5000")
print(f"✅ Public URL: {public_url}")
print(f"\nUpdate your React .env file:")
print(f"REACT_APP_API_URL={public_url}")
```

Alternative approach if above doesn't work:
- Use a different port (5001) for Flask
- Update ngrok to tunnel to 5001
- Provide the new URL

Make sure the code:
- Actually kills old processes
- Waits for port to be free
- Starts Flask cleanly
- Creates working ngrok tunnel
- Prints the correct URL to use in React

Provide complete working code for Google Colab.
